## La Loma Transformacion Foundation

La Loma Transformacion Foundation is a non-profit organization dedicated to supporting and improving the lives of the residents of a small town in Mexico called La Loma. As a volunteer developer for the foundation, I have developed a full-stack web application to help streamline various administrative tasks, manage user roles and permissions, and provide a platform for information sharing. As a volunteer developer, I have built this full-stack application using Laravel 8 for the backend, with authentication security, user management, roles, permissions, and various modules for processing donations, managing projects, and handling inventory. The front end is built using Bootstrap, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The database used is MySQL, where tables are properly normalized and have relationships to ensure data integrity.
